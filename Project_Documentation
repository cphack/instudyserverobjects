Study group formation and engagement by Teachers and Students.

App Name: In-Study
Developers: Alex C, and Hemanth K.

Brief overview:
	The main intent is to bring together a body of users 
	on-line in the app to collaborate on any subject matter.

	This app allows the users to subscribe to a number 
	of groups available, which have either been setup , or 
	create a new group and push an invitation to the general 
	group membership of the availability of this service. 
	
	The group forms when 2 or more join a particular group.
	
	The users of the group interact on the app by posting 
	questions or answers, or sharing files or pictures.
	
	The administrator may hand off his/her duties to other 
	administrator/s if there is a need

Types of users:

1. Administrator -- creator, can be any Teacher or student with this app
	a. Creates group and manages users.
	b. Limits the number of people in the group
	c. Controls geo location of group
	d. Able to do all the items in the user-type plus above
	e. Has control of material stored on his/her phone
 
2. User --- other teachers or students that use this app
	a. Requests to be part of this group
	b. Uses “chat: to communicate
	c. Able to transfer files within this group or other groups
	d. Use camera to take picture and transfer to group

Types of actions
	1. Application will share the location - so administrator 
	can automatically check in users in the group  or use a Q & A 
	session with option view to make the checkin process very 
	easy even when number of people in the group are more than 50.

How it works:
